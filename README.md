# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Performing employee research to help Pewlett Hackard HR Analyst, Bobby, identify individuals who will soon be retiring and how many positions will soon be open.

## Overview of the analysis:
In this analysis, we helped perform data analysis for Pewlett Hackard, a company with an aging population who will soon be retiring and leaving many positions open. 

The company currently only houses information in CSVs, so we first created a database and tables to house the information from the CSVs. We then were able to query the data to determine the following:
- Who was eligible to retire
- Determine how many current employees exist by department
- Create a list of employee information
- Create a list of management information
- Create a list of retirees by department

We then determined the following:
1) The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
2) The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program

## Results:
Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
- Based on the below (retirement_titles), we can see all employees and employee information, including employee number, first name, last name, and what title(s) they have or had. This table shows us that certain employees have had numerous different titles over the course of their employement with Pewlett Hackard.
