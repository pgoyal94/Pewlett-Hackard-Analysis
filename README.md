# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Performing employee research to help Pewlett Hackard HR Analyst, Bobby, identify individuals who will soon be retiring and how many positions will soon be open.

## Overview of the analysis:
In this analysis, we helped perform data analysis for Pewlett Hackard, a company with an aging population who will soon be retiring and leaving many positions open. 

The company currently only houses information in CSVs, so we first created a database and tables to house the information from the CSVs. We then were able to query the data to determine the following:
- Who was eligible to retire
- Determine how many current employees exist by department
- Create a list of employee information
- Create a list of management information
- Create a list of retirees by department

We then determined the following:
1) The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
2) The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program

## Results:

There is a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. (6 pt)

## Summary:

The summary addresses the two questions and contains two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight. (5 pt)
